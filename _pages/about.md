My name is Justin Lam. I've been writing software professionally for over a decade in various industries and using multitude of technologies. My primary focus is in the area of visualization, user experiences, and real time interactivity in games and mobile applications. 

In addition to my passion of coding, I also enjoy volunteering and spending time mentoring and teaching students of all ages.  I want to see more children grow up to learn, love and embrace how technology is built. I also want to equip any individual to have the skills to build software and related technology that can improve our civilization as a whole.  I have been active in Hunt the Wumpus high school mentorship and Swift and mobile coding camps at Microsoft. 

I am an advocate about helping those around me to grow, learn and be more passionate about technology and software. I am a life long learner about code, business and leadership.
