A friend once asked, “Wouldn’t it be so cool if we had an app for our wedding so that the single people can get to meet other singles. How about a Tinder-like app for our wedding?” My dear friend was going to get married with up to 500 guests and they gave me and my buddy a brilliant idea. This web app was specifically created for my friends for use at their wedding. You would sign in through your Facebook credentials then create your profile. Your profile consisted of a picture of yourself, your age, something interesting about you, and a contact if you found a mutual match with another individual. The idea is that you are presented with the profiles of others who have decided to sign up and if you find someone you are interested in getting to know better just “like” them. And if they “like” you back, hey, you’re connected and then you can meet up or get in touch. The whole scenario revolves around specific events, like my friends’ wedding, where profiles are more likely 1 or 2 degrees away from you. This provides meeting within proximity and event specific which provides potential meetups context and familiarity. Hopefully, many users that found our app useful were able to find a good match or the very least met a new friend.
