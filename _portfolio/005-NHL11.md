NHL 11 is an ice hockey video game celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the NHL series. The game features a physics-based game engine, which replaced the old animation-based system. The new engine allows for more natural plays and puck bounces, and simulates real interactions more accurately and realistically.Each bodycheck and collision is unique, such as glancing blows that spin a player, hip checks that completely upend opponents, or any other possible reactions. Player and puck movement now take momentum into account, and hits can be made high or low, with vastly different results. Other significant changes include broken sticks, which means the stick may now break when the player shoots. Players without sticks are able to kick or grab the puck, and teammates may offer their own stick as a replacement. Alternatively, the player may return to the bench for another stick. Discarded sticks remain “live” objects while on the ice; the new physics system allows interaction with skates, other sticks, and the puck Completely new additions to the game include user-controlled goal celebrations, disallowed goals, playoff beards, and “hustle”, a burst of speed that drains stamina quickly.
